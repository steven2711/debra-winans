        "text": "Nothing can inspire us more than a human story with which we can all relate; a story that encourages us to believe in our own dreams and to have faith in the promises of a God who sometimes seems far away. Debra Winans, in this work Life, Altered Not Over! takes the courage to let us into the private rooms of her silent journey through many of life’s narrow passages, and brings us a reason for hope in our own altered lives. This book is destined to be a source of spiritual inspiration for all who explore the wisdom on each page.",

        "text": "Debra deals with the reality of pain and provides an essential tool for hurting people. Having the privilege of traveling around the world and meeting thousands of people (many times in intimate settings), I have witnessed countless pain and struggles that cannot be alleviated because they do not have a “how-to- get-healed” tool. Debra has provided such a tool, this is a great read. Life, Altered Not Over! is a teaching manual and systematic healing tool.",

I was captivated as I read about Debra’s journey, and how her past pain has turned into her present power. You will be challenged to examine your own heart, forgive, and comfort others with the same comfort you have received. I commend Debra’s courage for writing this book!",
