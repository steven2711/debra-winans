Debra Winans, in this work Life, Altered Not Over! takes the courage to let us into the private rooms of her silent journey through many of life’s narrow passages, and brings us a reason for hope in our own altered lives. This book is destined to be a source of spiritual inspiration for all who explore the wisdom on each page.",

Having the privilege of traveling around the world and meeting thousands of people (many times in intimate settings), I have witnessed countless pain and struggles that cannot be alleviated because they do not have a “how-to- get-healed” tool. Debra has provided such a tool, this is a great read. Life, Altered Not Over! is a teaching manual and systematic healing tool.",

You told “your” story cleanly, without blame, but clearly! I loved the way you gave us, the reader, to opportunity to immediately reflect on our own situation with the journaling opportunities at the end of each chapter. You didn’t just us your pain, you brought us into your resolutions, lessons learned, and victories won. I hope another book is in your plan. Thank you for sharing your life with us.",

When Debra mentioned that she wrote a book, I knew that I wanted to read it. I looked her up on Facebook and messaged her. She said that the books were out of print at this time, but she had one copy left and she would send it to me and she did! What a woman of God! I was pleased to hear she has now reprinted the book! I pray that this book will bless you as much as it has blessed me. ",

How to forgive the other person but more importantly yourself. I had to go back and search myself for any residual anger and free myself from it. This book is liberating to say the least.",
